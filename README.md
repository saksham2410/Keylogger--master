# Keylogger-group9
A project Made for Object Oriented Programming in c++ course.
This keylogger will record Keystrokes, MouseClicks and store the data locally in an encrypted form using the Base64 encryption and will also send the recorded data via E-mail. This program will not show in running Programs under the task manager. Hence, this keylogger will have the exact capabilites as any popular keylogger in the market. Just run the main.exe file and the keylogger wil start in background. This keylogger currently works only on windows. Other features such as screenshots will be added later
